## Welcome to the Million Playlists Songs Dataset page

The Million Playlists Songs Dataset - MPSD (deliberately a tribute to the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/), whose work guided us during our efforts) comprises data fetched from four different sources of user-curated playlists. Since most of current studies already considered monitoring broadly used platforms such as Twitter, Last.FM and Spotify, we have, on the other hand, focused on crawling data from secondary platforms which, although not holding as much users as the aforementioned systems, also remains as an unexplored source of playlists data, with a representative number of enthusiasts and curated playlists.
